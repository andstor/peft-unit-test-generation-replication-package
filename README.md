## Analysis
From the generated data, we fix it using the `fix_data.ipynb` notebook. After fixing the data, we calculate the CodeBLEU scores using the `calc_similarity.ipynb` notebook. After code coverage is calculated (see the [evaluation](#evaluation) section), we calculate the statistics of the passing rate and coverage results using the `calc_execution_metrics.ipynb` notebook. Finally, we analyze the data and generate the plots using the `plots.ipynb` notebook.

```

|-- java-universal-parser/          Directory containing the Java parser used to validate generated code.
|-- fix_data.ipynb                  Jupyter Notebook file used to fix the generated data. Also calculates the syntactic validity of the generated code.
|-- calc_execution_metrics.ipynb    Jupyter Notebook file used to calculate the statistics of the passing rate and coverage results.
|-- calc_similarity.ipynb           Jupyter Notebook file used to calculate the CodeBLEU scores of the fixed data.

|-- tables.ipynb                    Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code used to analyze the extracted data and generate the resulting tables.
```

## Evaluation
Code coverage is calculated using the `evaluate_humaneval-x.py` script. Due to potential security issues with executing arbitrary generated code, we use Docker. Execute at your own risk. See the `evaluation/README.md` file for container build instructions.

## Replication
Follow the setup instructions within each directory. To replicate the experiments, each follow the steps below:

1. Train the models using the `run_train.py` script.
2. Construct the `methods2test_runnable` evaluation dataset by following the instructions in the `evaluation/methods2test_runnable/README.md` file.
3. Generate the unit tests for the `methods2test_runnable` dataset and the `humaneval-x` dataset using the `run_gen.py` script.
4. Fix the generated data using the `fix_data.ipynb` notebook.
5. Calculate the CodeBLEU scores using the `calc_similarity.ipynb` notebook.
6. Execute generated tests and collect coverage data by following instructions for running evaluation of the `methods2test_runnable` dataset and the `humaneval-x` dataset. See the respective `README.md` files for details.
7. Calculate the statistics of the passing rate and coverage results using the `calc_execution_metrics.ipynb` notebook.
8. Analyze the data and generate the figures using the `plots.ipynb` notebook.
9. Analyze the data and generate tables by running the `tables.ipynb` notebook.

Due to the variability of deep learning, we provide both the trained models and the generated results. The results are available in the `data/` directory. Metadata and links to the trained models can be found at [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/peft-unit-test-generation-experiments). Datasets are available at: [methods2test_small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/methods2test_small), [methods2test_meta](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/methods2test_meta), [methods2test_runnable](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/methods2test_runnable).
